Goal: Mobile-first polish so agents can use the CRM one-handed on iPhone/Android without pinch/zoom.

Scope (no new features, only UX/layout):

Leads (List)

On small screens, replace the table with a stacked card list showing: name, phone, city, property type, price/budget, status, score, and 3 quick actions (Call, SMS, RDV).

Keep the current table for ≥ sm breakpoints; auto-switch based on viewport.

Maintain existing helper functions for links (tel/sms/wa/ics).

Lead Drawer (Detail panel)

Add a sticky bottom action bar (visible only on small screens) with Call / SMS / RDV.

Keep the current grid of actions for desktop unchanged.

Ensure the drawer content scrolls but the action bar stays fixed.

Tap Targets & Spacing

All primary and icon buttons on mobile must have min height/width ≥ 44px with comfortable padding.

Increase spacing between touch elements to prevent mis-taps.

Pipeline (Kanban)

On mobile, columns stack vertically (single column).

Ensure cards have bigger paddings; scrolling is smooth.

Preserve current desktop layout from md and up.

Filters & Search

On mobile, compress top filter controls into a single “Filtres” button that opens a lightweight sheet/drawer containing search + select inputs.

On desktop, keep the existing inline filters.

Charts

Improve touch usability: larger tooltip text and easier tap area.

Optionally hide charts on very narrow widths if they become unusable, but do not remove them on desktop.

Accessibility & Semantics

Add aria-labels to icon-only buttons on mobile.

Ensure focus states are visible.

Do not change data or business logic.

Constraints:

Do not introduce new libraries; use existing stack (React, Tailwind, Recharts, lucide-react).

Do not change server or data shape.

Keep desktop behavior intact; changes are mobile-only unless stated.

Reuse existing helper functions (tel/sms/wa/ics) and styling patterns.

Keep diffs minimal and localized.

Styling Guide (Tailwind):

Use responsive utilities (sm:, md:, xl:) to switch between card list and table.

For tap targets, apply size utilities so the rendered area is ≥44px (e.g., padding + min-h/ min-w), but don’t hardcode pixel values if not needed.

Maintain the product’s current aesthetic (rounded-xl/2xl, soft borders/shadows, neutral palette).

QA Checklist (must pass before finishing):

iPhone 13/14/15 Pro, Android Pixel 6+:

No horizontal scroll; no zoom required.

Can add a lead, open it, call/SMS/RDV with a single thumb.

Sticky action bar stays visible while details scroll.

Pipelines scroll smoothly; no accidental taps.

Filters are accessible via one obvious button; search works.

All actionable icons have readable labels or tooltips for screen readers.

Charts don’t block scrolling; tooltips are legible on touch.

Deliverables:

A single PR that:

Introduces the mobile card list view for Leads (auto-selected < sm) and preserves the table ≥ sm.

Adds the sticky bottom action bar in the Lead drawer for small screens.

Enlarges mobile tap targets across list, drawer, and pipeline.

Wraps filter controls in a mobile drawer and keeps desktop filters intact.

Adjusts chart touch UX.

Update any component docs/comments to reflect responsive behavior.

No code unrelated to mobile UX.

Definition of Done:

Lighthouse Mobile Accessibility score ≥ 90 on the Leads and Lead Drawer views.

All QA checklist items met on at least one iPhone and one Android viewport in DevTools.

Desktop experience unchanged functionally and visually.
