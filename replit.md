# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
The client-side application is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing modern React patterns and hooks. The UI is built with shadcn/ui components, providing a consistent and professional design system. The application uses Wouter for client-side routing and TanStack Query for server state management and caching. The frontend follows a component-based architecture with reusable UI components and business logic separated into custom hooks.

## Backend Architecture
The server is built with Express.js and follows a RESTful API design pattern. The application uses a three-tier architecture:
- **Routes Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses
- **Storage Layer**: Abstracts database operations through a storage interface
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

Authentication is implemented using Passport.js with local strategy and session-based authentication. Password hashing is handled using Node.js crypto module with scrypt.

## Data Storage
The application uses PostgreSQL as the primary database with Drizzle ORM providing type-safe database operations and migrations. The database schema includes:
- **Users table**: Stores agent information with role-based access
- **Prospects table**: Contains comprehensive prospect data including contact information, property details, budget, and interaction history
- **Session store**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage for authentication

## Authentication and Authorization
Session-based authentication is implemented with:
- Local username/password strategy via Passport.js
- Secure password hashing using scrypt with random salt
- Role-based access control (admin/agent roles)
- Session persistence in PostgreSQL
- CSRF protection through session management

## Build and Deployment
The application uses Vite for frontend bundling and development, with esbuild for server-side bundling. The project supports both development and production environments with appropriate optimizations and error handling.
